## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install (One-Time Setup)

1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed on your computer.<br>
    - You can check your version by opening a terminal or command prompt and running: java -version
        - If Java is not installed or the version is older than 17:
          Mac users: Follow [this Mac-specific guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) for installation.
          Windows/Linux: Download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

2. Download the latest version of SummonersBook from our [official website](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/releases).
    - Download the latest `summonersbook.jar` file available.

3. Place the file in a folder you want to use as the home folder for SummonersBook.
    - For convenience, you can create a new folder on your Desktop and place `summonersbook.jar` file in the new folder.

---
### Step 2: Running SummonersBook
1. Open a terminal or command prompt:

    - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit `Enter`.
    - Mac/Linux: Open the Terminal app. You can find the Terminal app in `Finder -> Applications -> Utilities`

2. Navigate to the folder where you placed the `summonersbook.jar` file. For example:
    - `cd /path/to/your/folder`

3. Run the application by entering this command in your terminal: `java -jar summonersbook.jar`

4. After a few seconds, the SummonersBook window will appear with some sample data.
    - You can clear the sample data before adding your own, as it will not be automatically overwritten.

The SummonersBook window should look like the image below:
![Ui](images/Ui.png)

### Step 3: Your First Team

Let's form your first balanced team to see SummonersBook in action!

**a) Auto-create a balanced team:**

```
group
```

🎉 **Done!** You just formed a balanced team in under 5 seconds. The team will appear in the team panel on the right.

### Step 4: Learn the Essentials (2-Minute Tutorial)

Now that SummonersBook is set up, let’s try some useful commands!

#### How Commands Work
SummonersBook uses simple text commands to manage your player roster.  
Commands generally follows this format:
```
command_word + prefix/VALUE (input) + prefix/VALUE (input)
```
- **Command** — what you want to do (e.g., `add`, `filter`, `view`)
- **Prefixes** — short labels that tell SummonersBook what kind of information you’re giving (`n/` for name, `rk/` for rank, `rl/` for role, etc.)

Some commands do not require inputs, and only need the command word (e.g. `help`).
Don’t worry — you don’t need to memorize them all. You can always type `help` to see the full list.

#### Example: Adding a Player
Let’s add a new player to your roster: `add n/Faker rk/Challenger rl/Mid c/Ahri t/Shotcaller t/Carry`
This means:
- `add` → You’re adding a player
- `n/Faker` → Name is **Faker**
- `rk/Challenger` → Rank is **Challenger**
- `rl/Mid` → Role is **Mid**
- `c/Ahri` → Main champion is **Ahri**
- `t/Shotcaller`, `t/Carry` → Optional tags describing their play style

After running this command, Faker will appear in your roster instantly!

---

#### 💡 Try Next
- `filter rl/Mid rk/Diamond` — See only **Diamond** ranked players with role **Mid**
- `view 1` — Check stats and performance trends of the **first** player
- `help` — See all available commands anytime

Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for complete details on all commands.

## Common Workflows

These workflows show you how to accomplish typical coaching tasks with SummonersBook.

### Workflow 1: Preparing for Scrimmage Night

**Your goal:** You have 10 players (2 for each role) and want to form 2 balanced teams for practice matches in one click.

**Steps:**

1. **Add your players to the system, one line at a time** (if they’re not already added):

```
add n/Faker rk/Master rl/Mid c/Ahri
add n/ShowMaker rk/Master rl/Mid c/Syndra
add n/Zeus rk/Grandmaster rl/Top c/Renekton
add n/Impact rk/Grandmaster rl/Top c/Gnar
add n/CoreJJ rk/Master rl/Support c/Leona
add n/BeryL rk/Master rl/Support c/Nautilus
add n/Deft rk/Grandmaster rl/ADC c/Jhin
add n/Gumayusi rk/Grandmaster rl/ADC c/Kai'Sa
add n/Cuzz rk/Master rl/Jungle c/Graves
add n/Smeb rk/Grandmaster rl/Jungle c/Elise
```
2. **Generate balanced teams:**
```group```

Wow, you now have 2 ready-to-play teams within seconds!

### Workflow 2: Finding Substitutes Mid-Tournament

**Your goal:** You need a **Master rank Support player** to fill a gap in your roster.

**Steps:**

1. **Filter your roster by role and rank:**
```filter rl/Support rk/Master```
→ SummonersBook will show only players with **Support** role at **Master** rank.

That's it! Just one command, and you have instantly found the right player!

### Workflow 3: Post-Match Performance Tracking

**Your goal:** Record player performance after a scrimmage to track improvement over time.

**Steps:**

1. **Record a win or loss for a team:**
   ```
   win 1
   ```
   → Adds a win for the team and its players (use `lose 1` to add a loss).

2. **Add performance stats for a player:**
   ```
   addStats 5 cpm/8.2 gd15/450 kda/4.5
   ```
   → Records CS per minute (8.2), gold difference at 15 min (+450), and KDA (4.5).

3. **View performance trends:**
   ```
   view 5
   ```
   → Charts show improvement or decline over the last 10 matches.

**Insight:** Spot underperforming players or rising stars instantly with visual trends.

## Features

### Notes About the Command Format
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME rk/RANK rl/ROLE c/CHAMPION [t/TAG ...]`, `NAME` , `RANK`, `ROLE`, `CHAMPION` are parameters which can be used
  as `add n/Faker rk/Grandmaster rl/ADC c/Sivir`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., `filter [rl/ROLE ...] [rk/RANK ...] [c/CHAMPION ...] [s/SCORE]` can be used as `filter rk/Gold`.

* Items followed by `...` can be used multiple times (or not at all).<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG ...]` can be omitted, used once (`t/friend`), or used multiple times (`t/friend t/family`).

### Notes About the Parameter Rules
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., `add n/Faker rk/Gold rl/Mid c/Ahri` is the same as `add rk/Gold n/Faker rl/Mid c/Ahri`.

* Most parameter values are case-insensitive **except** for the player `NAME` during the `add` command.<br>
  e.g. `rk/Gold` is the same as `rk/gold`.

### Key Terminology
* `INDEX` refers to the number shown in the **currently displayed** list of **players**, **starting from 1**.

* `TEAM_INDEX` refers to the number shown in the **currently displayed** list of **teams**, **starting from 1**.

### General Tips
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* As new **League of Legends** champions may be added in the future, you can find **all champions supported by SummonersBook** in the **[Appendix](#appendix)**.

## Player Management

### Adding a player: `add`

Adds a new player with mandatory details to your roster.

**Format:**
```
add n/NAME rk/RANK rl/ROLE c/CHAMPION [t/TAG ...]
```

**Notes:**
* `name` must be **3–16 alphanumeric characters** with **no spaces allowed**. It represents the in-game username, not the real name.
* Duplicate names are **not allowed**; attempting to add a name that already exists will result in an error.
* Tags are **optional** but must follow these rules:
    - **1–20 alphanumeric characters** per tag
    - **No spaces or special characters allowed**
    - **Case-insensitive duplicates** are not allowed (`friend` and `FRIEND` are considered duplicates)
    - Multiple tags in a single command must all be unique
* If tags are provided, they are associated with the player at creation.

**Examples:**

* Adds the player "Faker" with the rank Grandmaster, role ADC, and champion Sivir.
```
add n/Faker rk/Grandmaster rl/ADC c/Sivir
```
* Adds the player "Imissher" with the rank Gold, role Support, and champion Thresh.
```
add n/Imissher rk/Gold rl/Support c/Thresh
```
* Adds the player "Doublelift" with multiple tags:
```
add n/Doublelift rk/Platinum rl/ADC c/Jinx t/friend t/ally
```
* Invalid: attempting to add duplicate tags (case-insensitive):
```
# Error: duplicate tag detected
add n/Player1 rk/Gold rl/Mid c/Ahri t/friend t/Friend 
```
### Listing all players: `list`

Shows a list of all players in your SummonersBook roster.

**Format:** 
```
list
```
<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use this command to reset any filters and see your full roster again.

</box>

### Finding players by name: `find`

Searches for players by **keyword(s)** in their **name**.
If multiple keywords are given, players with at least 1 keyword in their name will be shown.

**Format:**
```
find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...
```

**How it works:**
- Matching is **case-insensitive**
- Based on **whole words only** (not partial matches)
- OR logic: returns players matching ANY keyword

**Examples:**

* Finds **Faker**, **Deft**, but **not** **Canyon**.
```
find faker deft
```
* Finds **Faker**, but **not** **Faker2** or **Faker3** (fails partial match).
```
find faker
```

### Filtering players: `filter`

Narrows the player list by using one or more filters.

You can filter by:
- `rl/` — role (exact match), can be used multiple times
- `rk/` — rank (exact match), can be used multiple times
- `c/` — champion (exact match), can be used multiple times
- `s/` — score (shows players with score rating greater or equal to the given value), supply it **only once**!
  - **We only accept up to 2 decimal places** (e.g. `3.4`, `7.89`), any inputs beyond 2 d.p. (e.g. `5.678`) will be rejected!
  - If more than 1 `s/SCORE` field is provided, an error message will appear.
  
**Format (any order, at least one filter):**
```
filter [rl/ROLE ...] [rk/RANK ...] [c/CHAMPION ...] [s/SCORE]
```

**How it works:**
- Filters of **different types** (e.g. `rl/` and `rk/`) are combined with **AND**.
- Filters **within the same type** (e.g. multiple `rl/` values) are combined with **OR**.
- Matching is **case-insensitive** and **exact**

**Examples:**
* Filters players who have roles **Mid** OR **Jungle**.
```
filter rl/Mid rl/Jungle
```
* Filters players who have role **Mid** AND rank **Gold**.
```
filter rl/Mid rk/Gold
```
• Filters players who have roles (**Mid** OR **Jungle**) AND ranks (**Gold** OR **Silver**).
```
filter rl/Mid rl/Jungle rk/Gold rk/Silver
```

### Viewing detailed player information: `view`

Opens a detailed window showing comprehensive information about a player, including their performance statistics visualized in graphs.

**Format:**
```
view INDEX
```

**How it works:**
* The window displays:
    - Basic information (name, role, rank, champion, tags)
    - Win/loss record
    - Performance score over time
    - Creep Score per minute trends
    - Gold difference at 15 minutes trends
    - Kill/Death/Assist score trends
* Up to the latest 10 matches are shown in the performance graphs.

**Examples:**
* Open a detailed window for the 1st player in the list
```
view 1
```
* Opens a detailed window for the 5th player in the list.
```
view 5
```

### Editing a player: `edit`

Updates an existing player's details in your roster.

**Format:**
```
edit INDEX [n/NAME] [rl/ROLE] [rk/RANK] [c/CHAMPION] [t/TAG ...]
```

**How it works:**
* Existing values are **overwritten** by the new input.
* Tags are **replaced**, not added. To clear all tags, type `t/` with no tag values.
    * Tags must follow these constraints:
    - **1–20 alphanumeric characters** (no spaces or symbols)
    - **Case-insensitive duplicates** are not allowed (`friend` and `FRIEND` are considered duplicates)
    - Multiple tags in one command must all be unique

**Note:**
* At least one field to edit must be provided.

<box type="important" seamless>

**Important:** An edit will be rejected if it creates a role or champion conflict within the player's current team. To avoid this, you may need to ungroup the team first using `ungroup`.

</box>

**Examples:**
* Updates name, role, rank, and champion of the 1st player in the list.
```
edit 1 n/John Doe rl/Mid rk/Diamond c/Ahri
```
* Clear all tags of the 2nd player in the list.
```
edit 2 t/
```
* Updates only the role and rank of the 3rd player in the list.
```
edit 3 rl/Top rk/Gold
```
* Replace tags of the 4th player with `friend` and `ally`.
```
edit 4 t/friend t/ally
```
* **Invalid:** attempting to add duplicate tags (case-insensitive).
```
edit 5 t/Friend t/friend
```
### Deleting a player: `delete`

Removes a player permanently from your roster.

**Format:**
```
delete INDEX
```

**How it works:**
* Deletes the player at the specified `INDEX`.

<box type="important" seamless>

**Important:** You cannot delete a player who is currently on a team. Remove them from the team first using `ungroup`.

</box>

**Example:**
* Delete the 3rd player in the list.
```
delete 3
```

## Performance Tracking

### Adding performance stats: `addStats`

Records a new set of performance values for a player after a match:
- Creep score per minute (CPM)
- Gold difference at 15th minute (GD15)
- Kill/Death/Assist score (KDA)

**Format:**
```
addStats INDEX cpm/CPM gd15/GD15 kda/KDA
```
**How it works:**
* A new set of performance values (CPM, GD15, KDA) will be added.
* These values will be recorded and the player's average performance score will be updated automatically.

**Notes:**
* All fields must be provided.
* CPM must be a decimal between 0.0 and 40.0
* GD15 must be an integer between -10,000 and 10,000
* KDA must be a decimal between 0.0 and 200.0
* Decimal point is a dot `.`

**Example:**

* Records 8.8 CS per minute, +2000 gold lead at 15 min, and 6.0 KDA for the 1st player in list.
```
addStats 1 cpm/8.8 gd15/2000 kda/6
```

→ Player 1's overall performance score updates automatically.
→ View trends with `view 1`

### Removing performance stats: `deleteStats`

Deletes the most recent performance record for a player (useful for correcting mistakes).

**Format:**
`deleteStats INDEX`

**How it works:**
* The most recent set of performance values (cpm, gd15, kda) will be deleted.
* The player's average score will be recalculated automatically.

**Example:**
* Removes the latest performance entry for the 1st player in the list.
```
deleteStats 1
```
---

### Recording a team win: `win`

Records a win for a team, updating both the team's record and all team members' individual records.

**Format:**
```
win TEAM_INDEX
```

**How it works:**
* The selected team will have its win count incremented.
* The team's members will also have their win counts incremented.

<box type="important" seamless>

**Important:** If a team is removed, all its recorded wins and losses are deleted. Even if you later create a new team with the same players, the previous team's win/loss record will **not** be restored.

</box>

**Example:**
* Records a win for the 1st team in the list.
```
win 1
```
---

### Recording a team loss: `lose`

Records a loss for a team, updating both the team's record and all team members' individual records.

**Format:**
```
lose TEAM_INDEX
```

**How it works:**
* The selected team will have its loss count incremented.
* The team's members will also have their loss counts incremented.

**Example:**
* Records a loss for the 2nd team in the list.
```
lose 2
```

## Team Management

### Auto-grouping players into teams: `group`

Automatically forms as many teams of 5 as possible from **unassigned** players. 
The system will form teams of players with **similar ranks** (where possible).
The team will have **1 player of each role**, with **no duplicate champions**.

**Format:**
```
group
```
**Notes:**
* At least one unassigned player for each of the five roles is required to form a team.
* Only players **not already in a team** are considered.
* If champion conflicts prevent forming a team, the algorithm stops and reports how many teams were created.
* Any remaining unassigned players stay in the pool and can be grouped later.

**Note:** This creates **rank-ordered** teams where Team 1 contains the highest-ranked player from each role, Team 2 contains the next-highest-ranked player from each role, and so on.
If you wish to find out more about how **rank-ordered** team formation works, click [here](#understanding-rank-ordered-teams)

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Common Mistake:** Make sure you have at least 1 player per role (Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support). The algorithm can't form teams with missing roles.

</box>

---

**How it works (Optional):**

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Groups all unassigned players by their roles (Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support).
2. Sorts each role group by rank (highest to lowest).
3. Iteratively forms teams by selecting the highest-ranked available player from each role.
4. Ensures no duplicate champions within each team to avoid conflicts.
5. Continues creating teams until there are insufficient players to form a complete team.

#### Group vs. Manual: When to Use Which?

| Use `group` when... | Use `makeGroup` when... |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| You have 10+ players and need teams fast | You want to test specific player chemistry |
| You want rank-based skill tiers | You're experimenting with off-meta strategies |
| You're running multiple scrimmages simultaneously | You need one custom team for a tournament |
| Fair role distribution matters | You want to balance teams by playstyle (not rank) |

**Example scenario:**
You have 50+ players and 2 hours before scrims:
1. Use `makeGroup` to create 1 custom team for a specific playstyle/champion lineup
2. Run `group` → Creates 9 teams instantly

---

#### Tips for Maximizing Teams Formed

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Problem:** `group` only creates 2 teams when you expected 3.

**Common causes:**
1. **Champion pool diversity** — e.g. People with different roles playing the same champions
2. **Role imbalance** — Having 6 ADCs but only 2 Supports limits teams to 2

**Solutions:**
- **Before grouping:** Run `filter rl/Mid` to check champion diversity per role
- **Ask players to use other champions** — Use `edit INDEX c/CHAMPION` to update a player's champion
- **Strategic recruiting** — Use `filter` to identify which roles need more players

</box>

#### The issue of leftover players
**Note:** A limitation of the current algorithm: it always picks the highest-ranked player for each role, so running `group` again produces the same teams and leftover players.

If the number of players isn’t a multiple of 5 (e.g., 17 players), `group` will form only complete teams (3 teams = 15 players), leaving the remaining players unassigned.
**Options to handle leftovers:**
- **Add more players** to form another full team.
- **Use `ungroup` + `makeGroup`** to manually create a team including leftover players.
- **Edit champions** (`edit INDEX c/CHAMPION`) to resolve conflicts blocking team formation.
- **Wait for more players** to accumulate before forming the next team.

---

### Manually creating a team: `makeGroup`

Creates a new team with the specified players by their index numbers.

**Format:**
```
makeGroup INDEX_1 INDEX_2 INDEX_3 INDEX_4 INDEX_5
```

**How it works:**
* The selected players will be verified if they form a valid team.
* Once verified, the team is created and added to your team list.

**Notes:**
* `INDEX` (1 to 5) refers to the number shown in the displayed player list. Must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3…).
* **Exactly 5** index numbers must be provided.
* Players **cannot already belong** to another team.
* All players must have **unique roles**
* All players must have **unique champions**

**Example:**
* Creates a new team with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th players in the **currently displayed list**.
```
makeGroup 1 2 3 4 5
```
### Viewing team details: `viewTeam`

Opens a detailed window showing comprehensive information about a team, including all members and the team's win/loss record.

**Format:**
```
viewTeam TEAM_INDEX
```

**How it works:**
* A new window displays team member details and win/loss record.

**Example:**
* Opens a detailed window for the 1st team in the list.
```
viewTeam 1
```

---

### Disbanding teams: `ungroup`

Removes one or more teams from the system, returning their members to the unassigned pool.

**Format:**
```
ungroup TEAM_INDEX
```
or
```
ungroup all
```

**How it works:**
* Use `all` (case-insensitive) to disband all teams at once.
* After ungrouping, all team members become available for forming new teams.
* If there are no teams, the command will show an error.

**Example:**
* Disbands the 1st team in the displayed team list.
```
ungroup 1
```
* Disbands all teams, making all players unassigned.
```
ungroup all
```

## Data Import/Export

### Exporting data: `export`

Exports player or team data into a CSV file for backup or analysis. You may specify a custom save location.

**Format:**
```
export players [to CUSTOM_PATH]
```
or
```
export teams [to CUSTOM_PATH]
```

**Notes**
* Default export locations:
  - `data/players.csv`
  - `data/teams.csv`
* If a file already exists at the specified location, it will be overwritten.
* Files must end with the `.csv` extension.
* CSVs are structured for easy re-import or use in spreadsheets.

**Examples:**
* `export players`
  Exports all player data to default path `data/players.csv`.

* `export teams to data/myTeams.csv`
  Exports all team data to a custom path `data/myTeams.csv`.

**Success message:**
```
Exported players to data/players.csv
```

### Importing player data: `import`

Imports player data from a CSV file into SummonersBook.

**Format:**
```
import players from FILE_PATH
```

**Notes:**
* The CSV file must be properly formatted. Supported headers include:
    - `Name,Role,Rank,Champion`
    - `Name,Role,Rank,Champion,Wins,Losses`
* Duplicate/invalid player entries (by name and role) will be ignored automatically.
* The file path must point to a valid `.csv` file (e.g. `data/players.csv`).

**Examples:**
* `import players from data/players.csv`
  Imports players from data/players.csv.

**Success message:**
```
Imported 10 player(s), skipped 0 duplicate(s), 0 invalid row(s).

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to delete this player. This player is currently in a team."

**Problem:** You tried to delete a player who is assigned to a team.

**Solution:** Ungroup the player's current team first:
1. `ungroup 1` (disband their team)
2. `delete 5` (now you can delete the player)

### "No teams could be formed"

**Problem:** Not enough players or missing a required role when running `group`.

**What to check:**
- Run list and confirm you have at least 5 ungrouped players. 
  - If some players already belong to teams, use ungroup to free them. 
- Check if there’s at least one player **not in a team** for each of the 5 roles: Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support. 
  - Run `filter rl/Top`, `filter rl/Mid`, etc. to verify. 
- Ensure players have unique champions within a potential team. 
  - Example: Two players both using “Ahri” would block auto-grouping.

**Quick fix:** Add missing role players. 
- Example: 
```
add n/... rl/Support ...
```

### Invalid index

**Problem:** You entered a player number that doesn't exist in the current displayed list.

**Solution:**
1. Always run `list` first to refresh the player list and see current player numbers.
2. Remember that numbers change after filtering or deleting.
3. The index must refer to the **displayed list index**, not the total roster.

**Example:**
```
filter rl/Support    # Now you're seeing only 3 players
view 5               # ERROR - only 3 players are displayed
view 2               # OK - refers to 2nd player in filtered list
```

### Duplicate roles/champions when manually creating teams

**Problem:** Multiple players in the same team play the same **role** or **champion**.

**Explanation**:
Each team in SummonersBook follows the standard 5-role composition: Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, and Support.
To ensure balanced and valid teams, each player in a team must have a **unique role** and **champion**.

**Solution:**
- Edit the conflicting player’s details accordingly using the edit command :
  - Examples:
    - for duplicate role:
      ```
      edit 3 rl/ADC 
      ```
    - for duplicate champion:
      ```
      edit 3 c/Yasuo
      ```
- Alternatively, use the `group` command to automatically form valid teams. SummonersBook will handle role and champion assignments to prevent duplicates.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file from your previous SummonersBook home folder (located at `[JAR file location]/data/summonersbook.json`).

**Q:** Why can't I delete a player who's on a team?<br>
**A:** Team rosters must always have 5 players. Ungroup the player's current team (via `ungroup`), then delete the player.

**Q:** How are teams named when using `makeGroup` or `group`?<br>
**A:** Sequentially (`Team 1`, `Team 2`, …)

**Q:** Can I undo a command?<br>
**A:** SummonersBook does not currently support undo. However, data is auto-saved after each command, so you can manually revert by editing the data file (advanced users only) or re-entering the data.

**Q:** What's the difference between `find` and `filter`?<br>
**A:** `find` searches by player **name** (keywords), while `filter` narrows by **attributes** (role, rank, champion, score rating). Use `find` for "Who was that player called John?" and `filter` for "Show me all Diamond supports".

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut
   `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to
   manually restore the minimized Help Window.

## Glossary

### General Terminology

**Java**
: The programming language required to run SummonersBook (version 17 or higher).

**Command Line / Terminal**
: A text-based interface where you type commands to interact with the application.

**JAR file**
: A packaged Java application. You can run SummonersBook from its JAR file using the command `java -jar SummonersBook.jar`.

**Index**
: The number displayed next to a player or team in a list (starting from 1). Commands like `view`, `delete`, and `edit` use this index to identify a target.

**Parameter**
: A value supplied after a command to provide specific details (e.g., in `view 1`, the parameter is `1`).

**CSV file**
: A Comma-Separated Values file, similar to a spreadsheet, used for importing or exporting player and team data.

**Path**
: The location of a file on your computer (e.g., `data/players.csv`).

**JSON file**
: The internal data file format where SummonersBook automatically saves all your information.

**GUI / Window**
: The Graphical User Interface that opens when you run SummonersBook, displaying all the information visually.

---

### Domain-Specific Terminology

**Champion**
: A playable character in *League of Legends*. SummonersBook validates champion names against an internal list stored in `champions.txt`. Only names from this list are accepted (case-insensitive). If a newly released champion (e.g., *Aurora*) is not yet recognized, the input will be rejected until the list is updated in a future release.

  > To view the full list of supported champions:
  > 1.  Navigate to the application's resource files.
  > 2.  Open the `champions.txt` file, which contains all valid champion names.

**Role**
: A player's designated position on the team. A valid team requires one player for each of the five standard roles: **Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC (Attack Damage Carry), and Support**.

**Rank**
: A tier representing a player's skill level, similar to a chess rating (e.g., Gold, Diamond). It is the primary attribute used by SummonersBook to create balanced teams.

**Performance Statistics (Stats)**
: Metrics that quantify a player's performance in a match.
*   **CPM (CS per Minute)**: A measure of a player's efficiency at earning in-game gold.
*   **GD@15 (Gold Difference at 15 minutes)**: A player's gold lead or deficit against their direct opponent at the 15-minute mark.
*   **KDA (Kills/Deaths/Assists Ratio)**: A ratio `(Kills + Assists) / Deaths` indicating combat effectiveness.

**Scrim**
: An organized practice match between two teams, used to test strategies and evaluate players.

**Rank-Ordered Team**
: A team automatically created by the `group` command. It is formed by selecting the highest-ranked available player for each of the five required roles, while ensuring no duplicate champions. The algorithm sorts players by rank within each role separately, then selects the highest-ranked player from each role for Team 1, the next-highest-ranked player from each role for Team 2, and so on. When champion conflicts occur, lower-ranked players may be selected to avoid duplicates. This creates tiered teams (Team 1 > Team 2, etc.).

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Smart Team Formation *(Planned)*

**Goal:**  
Develop a more comprehensive algorithm for balancing teams, beyond simple rank-based grouping.

**Why it matters:**  
Coaches often spend significant time trialing different player combinations to find balance. True synergy comes not only from player rank but also from how **champions and playstyles complement each other**.

**You’ll be able to:**
- Use `smartGroup` to generate **AI-informed team compositions** that consider champion synergies, recent performance metrics, and consistency trends.
- View a **balance score** reflecting how well players’ past stats and roles fit together.
- Switch between **standard** (rank-based) and **AI-enhanced** grouping for flexibility.

**User impact:**  
Coaches can reference past performance data instantly instead of manually testing combinations — greatly reducing the time and effort spent on lineup experimentation.

**Related commands:** `group`, `viewTeam`, `addStats`

---

### 2. Archived Teams & Player History *(Planned)*

**Goal:**  
Keep the active roster clean while preserving valuable history.

**Why it matters:**  
Teams evolve over tournaments — users shouldn’t have to delete data to stay organized.

**You’ll be able to:**
- Move retired players and past teams into an **Archive** with one command.
- **Filter, search, and restore** archived entries seamlessly.
- View **historical win/loss records** to track progression across seasons.

**User impact:**  
Reduces clutter while maintaining institutional memory for coaching analytics.

**Related commands:** `list`, `find`, `import`, `export`

---

### 3. Undo/Redo & Command History *(Proposed)*

**Goal:**  
Make experimentation risk-free.

**Why it matters:**  
Fast CLI workflows mean errors happen — deleting the wrong team or player shouldn’t be irreversible.

**You’ll be able to:**
- **Undo or redo** recent actions (`add`, `edit`, `delete`, `ungroup`).
- View a **command history log** with timestamps and success states.

**User impact:**  
Encourages coaches/team managers to confidently explore new team setups while ensuring data safety.

**Related commands:** `edit`, `ungroup`, `delete`

---

### 4. Enhanced Import/Export System *(Planned)*

**Goal:**  
Enable full data portability — including player performance statistics.

**Why it matters:**  
Current CSV export/import excludes detailed player statistics (stats arrays), making long-term analysis and data sharing cumbersome.

**You’ll be able to:**
- Export all **player stats** (CS/min, GD@15, KDA) alongside basic player details.
- Export **full team breakdowns**, including average performance scores of every member.
- Import **complete player profiles** — SummonersBook will intelligently parse player statistics arrays and skip invalid rows automatically.

**User impact:**  
Provides full data continuity of player statistics between seasons or machines, allowing coaches to track performance history seamlessly.

**Related commands:** `import`, `export`, `addStats`

#### Algorithm Details

The auto-grouping feature uses a greedy role-based matching algorithm that prioritizes rank within each role while handling champion conflicts.

**For technical users interested in:**
- Detailed algorithm explanation and pseudocode
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Design alternatives and trade-offs
- Edge case handling

Please refer to the [Auto-Grouping Feature (specifically, the Design Considerations)](DeveloperGuide.md#auto-grouping-feature) section in the Developer Guide.

## Understanding Rank-Ordered Teams

**What "rank-ordered" means in practice:**

When you run `group`, SummonersBook creates **tiered teams** by selecting the highest-ranked player **within each role**:
- **Team 1** gets the highest-ranked Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, and Support
- **Team 2** gets the next-highest-ranked player for each role
- **Team 3** gets the remaining players

**Example (assuming no champion conflicts):**
You have 15 players distributed across roles with unique champions:
- **Top**: 1 Grandmaster, 1 Master, 1 Diamond
- **Jungle**: 1 Grandmaster, 1 Master, 1 Platinum
- **Mid**: 1 Grandmaster, 1 Diamond, 1 Platinum
- **ADC**: 1 Master, 1 Diamond, 1 Platinum
- **Support**: 1 Master, 1 Diamond, 1 Platinum

After running `group`:
- **Team 1**: GM Top, GM Jungle, GM Mid, Master ADC, Master Support (highest-ranked per role)
- **Team 2**: Master Top, Master Jungle, Diamond Mid, Diamond ADC, Diamond Support
- **Team 3**: Diamond Top, Platinum Jungle, Platinum Mid, Platinum ADC, Platinum Support

**Note:** If champion conflicts exist (e.g., the GM Mid and Master Support both play Ahri), the algorithm will skip players with conflicting champions and select the next available player from that role. This may result in teams that deviate from the pure rank-ordering shown above.

This is **different from balanced grouping**, which would mix ranks across teams to make all teams equal strength.

**Why tiered teams are useful:**
1. **Structured scrimmages** — Team 1 vs Team 2 provides high-level competitive practice
2. **Clear progression paths** — Players see what skill level they need to reach to move up
3. **Benchmarking** — If Team 3 beats Team 1, you know something unexpected happened
4. **Realistic tournament prep** — Your Team 1 can practice against external teams while Team 2/3 develop
